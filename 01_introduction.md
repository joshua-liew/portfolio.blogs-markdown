## What Kind Of Person Should I Be?

Why should one carry out one's actions? Or more personally, what kind of person should I be?
This is a question that I often ask myself - to what principles do I adhere to or aim for?
I have realized that the best people, not in terms of 'success' but in terms of __character__,
often have these figured out. Likewise, the level to which they are respected also seem 
to be related to the *quality* of their answers to these questions of 'ethics', and also to their
*ability to live/embody* those out.

So, what kind of person do I want to be? God-willing,
I hope that I may be a person of **honesty, integrity, and hard work**.
> ... to examine just one of those truths, the articulation of which occurs over and again 
in the Great Western intellectual tradition. It's accessed typically by a means of a question,
not the question of what we are to do - as important as that is - but rather
'what kind of person we ought to be'.
>> Bp. Robert Barron, at the [171st Commencement Ceremony of Hillsdale College](https://youtu.be/VFJYF3MiZLU?si=CV-eHWZRiERRmDTf&t=226).


### On Honesty

My father is an honest man.
He is an unassuming and simple person; working 9-to-5, doing the necessary with minimum fuss, and without need for attention.
In his dealings in work and with people, and I believe to the best of his ability,
he deals with fairness and truth. He models honesty, something which my younger self did not understand, but that I now
admire so much.

How could he go about in quiet diligence? I think it was because he is __honest with himself__.
He knows what he is and accepted what was given to him - both the pleasant and unpleasant.
In doing so, he need not pretend that he is something else, freeing him to act simply and diligently.

How could he deal with fairness? I think it was because he is __honest with others__.
He knows what he could offer, and what worth the work of his hands could bring to others.
Coupled with the confines of his good conscience, he would not ask for anything more than he could offer.
This freed him to deal with fairness and in good trust.

I hope that I can emulate such honesty.

### On Integrity

So much can be said about the hyper-connected, transactional digital age;
where much is done to be seen, as evidenced by the nature of Social Media platforms,
and much is lived to gain from the other. And no doubt, I too get caught up in these
'I scratch your back, you scratch mine' patterns of living.

I do not intend to debate the good and bad of this matter, but would like to pose a separate question:
__*how should I act/work when there is no one watching, and where there isn't anything to be gained?*__
Can I pay attention to the most minute details, producing high-quality work regardless of whether I
would be seen or evaluated? Will I stick to my principles when presented with justly/legally-earned but dishonest gain?
Could I seek the good, true, and beautiful as an end in themselves, even when there is nothing to be gained through them?

A person capable of embodying the answer to those questions, is a person of integrity.  
I hope that I can be such a person, whole and complete.
> integrity (noun): the quality of being whole and complete
>> Cambridge Dictionary, on the [meaning of integrity](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/integrity).

### On Hard Work

I believe that there is __intrinsic value__ in hard work. It has helped me through days of melancholy,
and kept my feet on the ground during times of cheer. It goes without saying that hard work can be 
unpleasant and difficult at times. However, the joy of pursuing a difficult goal,
the effort and responsibility needed to achieve it, and the goodness in perseverance all speak
to me about the quiet heroism and meaning intrinsic to hard work.

Such a value and meaning I hope to obtain, as I discipline myself in becoming a
hard-working person.

## What Do These Mean Anyways?

> "Joshua, you say all these good sounding abstract stuff but what do they mean to you anyways?"

Well, let's look at it practically then, and what they mean to me. Simply put, based on these
virtues, I aim to become a __competent person__. Also, given the space,
I try to give as much __time and effort__ necessary to solving the problems laid before me.
Now that doesn't mean I will solve them nor does it mean that my best will be enough, but it
means you know full well that I'll give my best and a solid crack at them.

### To Become Competent

A recent hero of mine, David Heinemeier Hansson 
(DHH, the creator of Ruby on Rails and co-owner of 37 signals, among much more)
said the following in an interview which has stuck with me ever since.
> If you approach this as like competence is important; understanding is important;
pulling the thread is important; sometimes struggling a bit is important; these are skills
you take forward and they just make everything better, they make everything faster,
they make everything more fun.  
__It is just more fun to be competent.__
>> DHH, on the [Top Shelf Podcast](https://youtu.be/mTa2d3OLXhg?si=8X6iIkusdN3mxwqY&t=1094)
in 2024.

__"It is just more fun to be competent".__ Nothing more needs to be said. 
As much as I am able to do so, I try to aim for competence which means choosing the 
difficult things. For example, *slogging through documentation to learn; not relying on/using
AI tools; striving for understanding above and beyond productivity; and so on.*
Because it is persevering through the difficult things that brings about competence,
which grants dignity to one's work.

### To Put In Time & Effort

On a similar note, Michael Paulson (better known as ThePrimeagen, former Netflix engineer)
speaking on 'Developer Excellence', states that with such a mindset you can then
take a chance on yourself.
> When something is super difficult - say Groovy, a language you never worked on, and a
tech-stack you never worked on, being the youngest person out of everybody on your team -
like when all the odds are against and you're not Gauss-smart, ... that if I __just had
time and determination__, I can achieve anything.
>> Michael Paulson (aka ThePrimagen), at the [Laracon US 2024 (Dallas, TX)](https://youtu.be/96VlfN7ViyE?si=HZde5e0o9SNNKP87&t=340)

This too I deeply agree with and know, albeit within my limited experiences.
That given the space and trust, __putting in the time, effort, and determination__
into the difficult things can bear fruit in many ways and prove to be very meaningful.
It is with this frame of mind that I try to approach all the things that I have done
and that are yet to befall me.

## The Problem & My Story: A Lack Of Humility

But there is a fundamental problem.  
In order to be honest, hard-working, and have integrity, one needs *humility*.
To put it in other words, the measure of one's virtue, depends on the measure to which
they are humble.

And I confess that this is what I truly lack. For I have this tendency 
to __incurvatus in se (to turn/curve in on myself).__ I often look to my own 'success'
instead of that of others, and *as I write this piece about myself, ironically*
I feel this tendency bubbling up inside.

I have had numerous experiences: highs and lows, pleasant and unpleasant - but all tainted
by this incurvatus in se. For example, crying in the bus on the way back from a wonderful 
academic conference because __I couldn't 'show the best of myself'__. Or not being grateful 
for opportunities, ones that are hard to come by, because __I felt like I 'deserved' them
    and that it was 'about time'__.

This is the story of my life I believe, from past to present, and present to future,
that in all things, this is a journey in search of humility.

> Do not imagine that if you meet a really humble man he will be what most people call
‘humble’ nowadays: he will not be a sort of greasy, smarmy person, who is always telling
you that, of course, he is nobody. Probably all you will think about him is that he
seemed a cheerful, intelligent chap who took a real interest in what you said
to him. If you do dislike him it will be because you feel a little envious of anyone who
seems to enjoy life so easily. He will not be thinking about humility: he will
not be thinking about himself at all.
>> C.S. Lewis - author of 'The Chronicles of Narnia' and 'The Space Trilogy'
